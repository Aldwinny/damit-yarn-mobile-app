## ✏️ Author

I'm Aldwin Dennis Reyes, an aspiring mobile developer. Check me out on my website [here!](https://aldwinny.github.io/)

This mobile app is created for the purpose of completing the college course Mobile Computing.

## 💻 Technologies

Primarily built with React Native and Expo, this mobile application also uses a variety of libraries through npm.

- Redux
- Nativewind (A React Native implementation of Tailwind)
- Axios
- Bcrypt
- React Navigation

The express js backend implementation can be found [here!](https://github.com/aldwinny/Damit-yarn-backend)

## 🔨 Building

After installing the packages, and resolving the .env file, the application is built by calling on <code>npm run build</code> which uses eas-cli to create an Android build of the application.
